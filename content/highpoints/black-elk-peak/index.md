Black Elk Peak, formerly known as Harney Peak, is in the Black Hills of South Dakota at the western part of the state.  The Black Hills have a decidedly more western feel, than most of the rest of the great plains of South Dakota.  There are a few routes to the top of the peak, but the one I took was started at picturasque Sylvan Lake which is part of Custer State Park.  There is an entry fee required to park within the state park.

The trail starts out with a gradual from the parking area next to Sylvan Lake, to ascend the ridge line.  Once on the ridge, there is a clear view of the summit across the valley.  The trail follows the ridge line and is in and out the forest.  The last push to the summit has a fair amount of switch backs.  At the very top is an old rock structure that served as a fire lookout.  The view towards the east shows the Black Hills dropping off into the prairie which extends to the horizion.
