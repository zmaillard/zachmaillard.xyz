Black Mesa is located at the far western end of Oklahoma, just a short distance from the Colorado and New Mexico borders.  Landscape wise, this is high plains, with mostly short grasses, Yucca, and some Pinon-Juniper woodlands along the side of the mesa.  There is not a lot of shade on this trail, and would be very exposed during the summer months.  I hiked this on a late March evening and the sun set while I was returning to the car.  Overall this is not a terribly challenging hike, but quite a beautiful one.
