Black Mesa is located at the far western end of Oklahoma, just a short distance from the Colorado and New Mexico borders.  The trail is 4.2 miles from the parking lot to the top of the mesa.  Landscape wise, this is high plains, with mostly short grasses, Yucca, and some Pinyon Pines along the side of the mesa.

Starting off from the parking lot the trail follows what appears to be an old jeep trail to the edge of the mesa itself.  The climb from the plains below the mesa to the top is short, and moderatly steep.  Once on the top of the mesa, the is seemingly flat as it leads to the highest part of the mesa.  At the top of a granite monument, that lists the directions and distance to the nearest states of New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas.  Overall this is not a terribly challenging hike, but quite a beautiful one.
