Hawkeye Point is surrounded by farmland, off of a busy highway.  I visted Hawkeye Point on a blustery May afternoon with my dog Ginger.  The grounds had displays about the local area, as well as sign posts showing the distance and direction to all of the other high points in the United States.  My local high point, Borah Peak being 903 miles away, made me feel a long way from home.
