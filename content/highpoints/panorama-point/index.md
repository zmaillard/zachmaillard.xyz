Panorama Point is another one of the high points that does not involve hiking.  In-fact, because it is located on an active Bison Ranch, the property owners only want visitors to the highpoint itself to come via an automobile.  The high point is located on the southwestern part of the Nebraska panhandle, not far from Wyoming and Colorado.

Getting to the high point involves a fair amount of driving on gravel roads.  The easiest access would be from I-80 either at Pine Bluffs, WY or Bushnell, NB.  Access from eastern Colorado would be from CO-71 in the Pawnee Grasslands.  There is a fee box at the turnoff from the county road.

The high point has a marker, and at the time I visted an old metal school desk that contained the summit register, and various trinkets.  Panorama Point is adjacent to a wind farm.  Overall, it is a beatiful spot on the high plains.  I would not recommend visiting in wet weather, as I imagine the road would be quite muddy.
