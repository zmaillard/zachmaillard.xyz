Panorama Point is another one of the high points that does not involve hiking.  In-fact, hiking and biking are prohibited, so really the only way to get this one is by car.  Panorama Point is part of the High Point Bison Ranch.  Getting to the high point involves a fair amount of driving on gravel roads.  The easiest access would be from I-80 either at Pine Bluffs, WY or Bushnell, NB.  Access from eastern Colorado would be from CO-71 in the Pawnee Grasslands.  There is a fee box at the turnoff from the county road.  The pictures really don't do the place justice, as the the high plains are just immense and my phone camera just can't capture the scale of the place.  I came through here in a hot mid July day.  There had been severe weather the night before, which I had partially expierenced while camping south of here in Colorado.
