Guadaulpe Peak is located in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in far western Texas.  The trail is located in the Chihuahuan Desert, and at the lower elevations means there is not much vegetation to provide shade.As you climb higher onto the mountain there are some small patches of forested areas.  Because the trail is so exposed, I would not recommend hiking this one in the middle of a summer day.  I hiked this trail in April, starting shortly after sunrise.  Heat was not an issue, but the winds at the top were quite strong.  The views were amazing from the top.
