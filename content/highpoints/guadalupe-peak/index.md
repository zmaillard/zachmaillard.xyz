Guadaulpe Peak is located in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in far western Texas.  Guadalupe Peak trail is the main route to the summit - starting at the Pine Springs Trailhead.  The trail is 4.2 miles from the trailhead to the summit - bringing the total out and back distance to 8.4 miles.  There is not much in the way of shade on this hike.  The park is located in the Chihuahuan Desert - so for the most part the plants are Yuccas and shrubs.  As you climb higher onto the mountain there are some small patches of forested areas.  Because the trail is so exposed, I would not recommend hiking this one in the middle of a summer day.

The trail immediatly starts out steep with a series of switchbacks as you climb up the mountain.  The views are very impressive, as the Guadalupe Mountains rise fairly steeply off the desert floor.  The trail itself is well maintained, and well marked.  Near the summit is a small campground that hikers with a backpacking permit can stay at.

At the very top is a metal marker that commerates the Butterfield Overland Mail  route.  The day I hiked, the wind was blowing pretty strong at the top.  The views to the south, east, and west from the top of the mountain are amazing.
