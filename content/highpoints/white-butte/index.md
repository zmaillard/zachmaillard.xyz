White Butte is a delightful hike.  I climbed White Butte on a warm Sunday in late June.  White Butte is located in the western part of North Dakota and are part of a series of buttes called the Chalky Buttes.  As you can see from the photographs, the buttes look almost pure white from a distance.

The trailhead and the butte itself are on private land.  There is a donation box at the trailhead - throw a few dollars in on your way up.  Getting to White Butte involves driving on well maintained gravel roads, that are well marked with directions to White Butte.

The trail starts out through some prarie with some wildflowers still blooming when I made the hike.  The climb to the top is not terribly steep, although I imagine that it would be more difficult if the trail was muddy or icy.  The view from the top is beautiful rolling Prairie and farmland, punctuated with the rest of the Chalky Buttes formation.  This was a great way to spend a June morning!
