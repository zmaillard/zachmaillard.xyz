Sassafras Mountain is in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northern South Carolina, on the border with North Carolina.  Except for a short hike from the parking lot, the summit is accessible by car.  The route I chose to hike this mountain was the Foothills Trail, starting just north of the community of Rocky Bottom on US-178.  The trail starts in a canyon along the Eastatoe Creek and is a steep climb to the summit.  It was a hot, humid, and sometimes rainy morning when I made this hike.  The vegetation along the trail was very lush, it felt like a rainforest.  The last quarter of my hike back to the car was a crazy cloudburst that literally felt like it was raining buckets.
