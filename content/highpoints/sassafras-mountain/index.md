Sassafras Mountain is in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northern South Carolina, on the border with North Carolina.  Except for a short hike from the parking lot, the summit is accessible by car.  At the top of the mountain is a large viewing platform.  The route I chose to hike this mountain was the Foothills Trail, starting just north of the community of Rocky Bottom on US-178.  The trail starts in a canyon along the Eastatoe Creek.

The trail climbs steeply out of the narrow valley where the parking area is.  The forest is thick, and when I hiked this trail in mid June, was quite lush.  The views from the trail are mostly of the canyon where the Eastatoe Creek runs.  At the top of the mountain is a large viewing platform where there is great views of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  The summit itself is adjacent to the North Carolina/South Carolina boundary.  The border itself is painted on the ground at the viewing area.
