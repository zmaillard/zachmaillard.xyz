Borah Peak is probably the hardest of the high points that do not require any special gear.  The standard Chicken Out Ridge route, is so named because of a rocky section that is somewhat exposed and requires scrambling. The exposure on the ridge can be intimidating, and hence is where pepole chicken out and turn back.  From the parking lot to the summit is 3.5 miles, a very steep 3.5 miles!  The crux of the trail is at the base of Chicken Out Ridge where the trail skirts along a narrow ridge line for around 20 feet or so.  When I hiked the trail on a mid July day, there was still snow on this stretch that was stamped down with boot tracks.  A slip here would spell disaster for sure.  In my opinion the hardest part of the hike was going back down.  The trail is very steep and the soil seems like a fine powder - which makes for pretty poor traction.  Definilty bring hiking poles, if for nothing else, than the climb back down.  Even with these, I slipped a few times on the way down.  Start early on this one, as summer thunderstorms are frequent, and there is no shelter from the lightning above treeline.  I started the hike at 5:00 AM on a July morning as was back to the car by 12:30 PM.
