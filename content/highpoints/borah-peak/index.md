route: Southwest (Chicken-Out) Ridge
state: Idaho
title: Borah Peak

Borah Peak is probably the hardest of the high points that do not require any special gear.  The standard Chicken Out Ridge route, is so named because of a rocky section that is somewhat exposed and requires scrambling. The exposure on the ridge can be intimidating, and hence is where pepole chicken out and turn back.  From the parking lot to the summit is 3.5 miles, a very steep 3.5 miles!  Those 3.5 miles gain over 5000 feet in elevation.

The crux of the trail is at the base of Chicken Out Ridge where the trail skirts along a narrow ridge line for around 20 feet or so.  When I hiked the trail on a mid July day, there was still snow on this stretch that was stamped down with boot tracks.  A slip here would spell disaster for sure.

The trail is well marked for the most part.  Chicken Out ridge is a choose your own adventure of how you want to traverse it.  Beyond that there is a good trail until near the top of the summit, at which point you are just climbing over scree to find the best route to the top.  The views from the summit are amazing, Borah Peak is part of the Lost River Range which has other very high peaks.  Certainly the view feels like you are at the top of the world.

In my opinion the hardest part of the hike was going back down, beyond Chicken Out Ridge.  The trail is very steep and the soil seems like a fine powder - which makes for pretty poor traction.  Definilty bring hiking poles, if for nothing else, than the climb back down.  Even with these, I slipped a few times on the way down.
