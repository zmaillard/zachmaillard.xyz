Borah peak is probably the hardest of the high points that do not require any special gear.  The standard Chicken Out Ridge route, is so named because of a rocky section that is somewhat exposed and requires scrambling.  However, Chicken Out ridge is more hyped than.

The crux of the trail is at the base of Chicken Out Ridge where the trail skirts along a narrow ridge line.  When i hiked the trail in July, there was still snow on this stretch.
