Mount Davis is located on a ridge that generally trends north/south across southern Pennsylvania and Maryland.  Below the ridge is rolling hills and agricultural land.  The summit is accessible by car.  Becuase the ridge is surrounded by private property, the best trail access was from a parking area on the crest of the ridge north of the high point itself at a county park.  The trail is a gentle walk through a forest, which comes out to the highpoint itself marked by a large metal viewing platform, with a steep staircase to climb to the top.  The forest is thick enough around the summit, that the only way to see above the trees is to climb the viewing platform.  The views from the top are to the valleys on either side of the ridge.
