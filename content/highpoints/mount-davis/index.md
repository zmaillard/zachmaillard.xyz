I made the trip to Mount Davis early in the morning on a sunny spring day.  The forest was still without leaves, save for an evergreen here and there.  The hike was a gentle trail through the forest that followed the ridge line south from the parking area to the viewing platform.  This would have been a fun bike ride along the country roads, up onto the ridge to Mount Davis.  The views were beautiful from the top.  I enjoyed climbing up the metal viewing platform.  This was my first out of three highpoints for the day.
