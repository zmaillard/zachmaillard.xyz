Spruce Knob has a paved road that goes all the way to the top.  However, I chose the Huckleberry Trail route, which is a steady climb up a ridge line to Spruce Knob.  I hiked this trail late on a clear spring day.  The views from the top show why West Virginia is called "The Mountain State".  The green mountains stretched as far as the eye could see in all directions.  This was the third and final high point I completed on that day.
