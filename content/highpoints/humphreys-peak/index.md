Humphreys Peak is located in the San Francisco Peaks between Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon.  The San Francisco Peaks are a prominent feature, and is a landmark especially from the deserts north and to the east.  The main trail starts at the Arizona Snow Bowl Ski Area.  The trail starts out in the forest, to the north side of the ski area with a series of switchbacks.  For the first part of the hike, the southern most parts of the switchback bump up against to the ski runs.  The climb is steady, and the forest provides good shade.

Just above treeline the trail reaches the saddle between Humphreys Peak and Mount Agassiz.  At this point, the trail becomes fairly rocky and follows the ridge line to the north.  I think this is the hardest part of the trail, because it is windy and slow going through the rocks.  From the top of the summit, the views are stunning, and to the north the south rim of the Grand Canyon is visible.
