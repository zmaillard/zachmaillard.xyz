Mount Elbert is the highest peak in Colorado, and is the second highest peak in the lower 48.  I wasn't really sure how to acclimate for this one, so I arrived in Leadville mid-afternoon the day before I hiked, and spent the afternoon walking around town.  Leadville is just over 10,000 feet in elevation.  The Mount Elbert hike is non-technical, but the high elevation is definitely a factor for this hike.  I was on the trail by 4:30AM, trying to avoid any afternoon thunderstorms that happen in this area.  As it was, the parking lot was very busy when I pulled up.  The hike starts out with a steady climb along the Colorado Trail, and then becomes steep, and then steeper.  There are two false summits that trick you into thinking you are almost done.  I didn't have any symptoms of altitude sickness, but you could tell that the air was thinner.
