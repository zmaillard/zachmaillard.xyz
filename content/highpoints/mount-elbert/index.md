Mount Elbert is the highest peak in Colorado, and in the Rocky Mountains, and is the second highest peak in the lower 48.  The Mount Elbert hike is non-technical, but the high elevation is definetly a factor for this hike.  The starting point is at the Elbert Campground at almost 10,000 feet.  An early start is recommended on this trail during the summer months, becuase of the risk of thunderstorms.  A lot of the trail is a above treeline, so if a storm does come up, it is difficult to find shelter.

The beginning of the trail follows the Colorado Trail south, and begins a gradual but steady climb through the forest.  When the North Elbert Trail splits off from the Colorado Trail, the climb steepens considerably.  At around 11,000 feet the trail leaves the forest and enters the alpine zone.  As you climb higher the trail becomes rockier, but the views really open up.  You truly feel like you are at the top of the world.

There are two false summits that you pass on the way up the mountain which add to the mental challenge.  The trail is pretty well defined, and there is not much in the way of scrambling.  The summit area actually feels quite large, and on the day I climbed in mid-July, there was a bunch of people at the top.  The views of the top are incredible, with the Sawatch Range to the west, and the Mosquito Range across the valley to the east.  Mount Massive, the second highest peak in Colorado is just north of the summit across the adjacent drainage; La Plata Peak the third highest peak in Colorado is to the south.
