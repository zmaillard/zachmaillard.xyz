## Description
Leaving NV-225, the road is a good gravel that follows Trail Creek through some bottom land and assorted ranches.  The road ascends to Maggie Creek Summit at 6066 Feet.  From the summit, the road drops through numerous Aspen groves before crossing Columbia Creek on a causeway of sorts.  

The road then climbs again to a smaller summit before rejoining the pavement at the beginning of NV-226.

Road conditions as of the Fall of 2019 was well graded gravel.  This stretch of road could easily be driven in a passenger car during dry months.
