## Description
The Wee Thump Wilderness Area is a small patch of Joshua Tree forest adjacent to a highway.  This is probably one of the easiest wilderness areas to get to, as there are no hikes in, and certainly no sketchy forest service roads.  Simply pull of the highway into a parking area and walk through a gate to enter the Wee Thump.

There are no maintained trails that I could make out, other than some old roads that cross the area.  To orient yourself, NV-164 runs along the south edge of the wilderness.  Beyond that is Cresent Peak, a prominent mountain visible from the wilderness area.  To get back to your car, you generally make your way back toward Crescent Peak.  If you cross the highway, you went too far.

The ground is mostly flat, and is crossed by some washes and old roads.  This is a good hike to bring kids as it is not difficult and as long as you don't head out there in the blazing Mojave Desert heat.  I took my family out here on Thanksgiving break.  The day was cold and blustery which made for very blue sky with some fast moving clouds above.
