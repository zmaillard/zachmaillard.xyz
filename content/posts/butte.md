The weekend after Thanksgiving I made a quick road trip through central Idaho, over [Lolo Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolo_Pass_(Idahoâ€“Montana)) and down into Montana - spending the night in [Butte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte,_Montana).  Butte is a fascinating city, built on the richest hill on earth,  with the fancy buildings in uptown to show off its wealth.  There are a lot of mining towns scattered throughout the west, but I think Butte is the biggest.  I got up early in the morning to watch the sunrise from [The Granite Mountain Speculator Mine Memorial](http://minememorial.org).  The pictures on this post are from that general location.  If you ever spend any time in Butte, be sure to get a Pork Chop Sandwich at [Pork Chop Johns](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pork-chop-sandwich-butte-montana).
